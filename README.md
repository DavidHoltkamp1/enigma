# enigma- self-assessment 

FUNCTIONALITY -- (3)Completed Enigma class with encrypt and decrypt functioning. Command Line Interface works as well. 

OOP -- (3) As it stands, I did not implement a module or inheritance. 

RUBY CONVENTIONS/MECHANICES -- (4) I believe all class, methods, and variables are well-named, and I do not believe any method is over 10 lines long. 

TDD -- (4) Used stubs to control the randomness of generating a key/date for testing. Coverage is at 100% as well. 

VERSION CONTROL -- (4) I have over 40 commits and I think my commits didn't include multiple pieces of functionality.
